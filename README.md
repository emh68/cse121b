# CSE 121B: JavaScript Course Overview

This document provides an overview of the **CSE 121B** course at BYU-Idaho, including key principles, outcomes, and the final project website built using JavaScript.

## Course Overview

In this course, principles learned in **CSE 110** and **CSE 111** are applied to solve specific problems. The course emphasizes **understanding** over completion, and success in this course is based on truly mastering JavaScript to solve real-world problems.

### Course Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Translate discipline-specific algorithms into JavaScript.
- Create JavaScript functions based on clear and well-defined descriptions.
- Set up and use the JavaScript development environment to solve problems.
- Write clean, efficient JavaScript code using proper syntax and comments.
- Find and evaluate reliable JavaScript help sources.

## Weekly Content Overview

## Course Structure

This is a **block course** with the following breakdown:

### **Weeks 1-5:**
- Assigned readings, quizzes, and programming tasks.  
- Topics include JavaScript syntax, functions, control structures, and working with arrays, objects, and the DOM.

### **Week 6:**
- **Project Week:** Apply JavaScript fundamentals in a discipline-specific project that demonstrates the ability to write working, effective JavaScript code.

### **Week 7:**
- **Reflection Week:** Reflect on the quality of JavaScript help sources and create rules for identifying reliable resources.

## Assessment & Validation

1. **Weeks 1-5:**  
   Each week, students validate their understanding by confirming whether they have:
   - Completed the tasks.
   - Gained a strong understanding of JavaScript syntax.
   - Reviewed provided solutions for alternative problem-solving approaches.

2. **Week 6:**  
   Students confirm the completion of their project, including understanding the code they wrote and using proper JavaScript syntax.

3. **Week 7:**  
   Students reflect and validate their ability to evaluate and describe the quality of JavaScript information sources.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Developing proficiency in translating algorithms into JavaScript.
- Gaining familiarity with JavaScript syntax, best practices, and debugging techniques.
- Building interactive web applications and understanding their backend integration.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6)
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Final Project: Website Built Using JavaScript

As part of the course, we developed a web application that applies JavaScript to solve a real-world problem. The project demonstrates the use of various JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, functions, and control flow.
